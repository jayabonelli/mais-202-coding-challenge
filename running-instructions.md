# HOW TO RUN MY SCRIPT
My python script is, trivially enough, the file titled: "script.py".
To run it, type "python script.py" into the command line. 
If the program executes correctly :) it will create two files in the current directory: 
the first is "output_table.csv", which is the csv file of the data table of the average interest rates; 
the second is "output_plot.png", which is a png image of the graph representing the data table. 
However, I have also written my program such that the data table and graph will also be displayed out of the command line (perhaps a bit redundant, yes, but just to be sure.)
Enjoy!
